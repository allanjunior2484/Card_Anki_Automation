Card_Anki_Automation
Web app to create Anki flashcards with audio, in bulk.

Application Description:

This web tool simplifies and speeds up the addition of flashcards to Anki. Through an online interface, the user provides the name of an existing Anki deck and inputs the content (front and back) of multiple cards at once.

Main Features:

Batch Creation: Allows adding multiple flashcards simultaneously.

Automatic Audio Generation: Automatically produces audio for the front text of each card (in English by default, using gTTS).

Anki Integration: Adds the cards, including the generated audio, directly to the Anki deck specified by the user.

Deck Validation: Verifies whether the provided deck name exists in Anki before processing the cards, preventing errors.

It is important that Anki is open with the required add-ons already installed.
